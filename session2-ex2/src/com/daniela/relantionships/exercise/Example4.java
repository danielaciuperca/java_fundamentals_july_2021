    We are building an application for a bank.
    We need to manage the various bank accounts open at the bank.
    The bank offers its clients the possibility to open debit or credit bank accounts.
    All bank accounts have a number and an amount. The debit bank accounts have a credit card
    attached. The credit card has its own number, the month and year of expiration.
    The credit bank accounts have a limit amount of money that can be borrowed.
    All bank accounts have a method to print in the console their details: the number and
    the amount.
